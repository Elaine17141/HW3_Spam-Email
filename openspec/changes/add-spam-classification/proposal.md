## Why
Spam email detection is a common and useful classification task. Adding a project capability for spam classification will allow us to explore machine learning workflows, establish data handling practices, and create a baseline model to iterate from.

## What Changes
- ADDED: A new capability `spam-classification` with a Phase 1 baseline implementation.
- PHASED: plan to add additional phases later (phase2, phase3...), currently left as placeholders.

## Phase 1 (baseline)
- Build a baseline spam classifier model using a classical ML approach (SVM) trained on the public SMS spam dataset.
- Dataset: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Cybersecurity/blob/master/Chapter03/datasets/sms_spam_no_header.csv
- Deliverables:
  - Data ingestion and preprocessing script
  - Baseline training script (SVM) and evaluation pipeline (metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
  - Saved model artifact and a short report describing baseline performance and failure cases

## Future Phases (placeholders)
- Phase 2: 
- Phase 3: 

## Impact
- Affected specs: new capability `spam-classification` (added)
- Affected code: new `ml/` or `models/` folder, `data/` and `notebooks/` for experiments, and CI jobs for training/eval checks if desired.

## Migration
No migration required; this is an additive capability.

## Non-Goals
- Production deployment of the model (serving) is out of scope for Phase 1.
- Large-scale dataset curation or advanced feature engineering are deferred to later phases.
